## 1. Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks with optional due dates.
- **List Tasks**: View your tasks, filtered by pending, completed, or all.
- **Mark Complete**: Easily mark tasks as done.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from your list.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear, colorful output powered by Rich.

## 2. Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: The core programming language.
- **Typer**: A modern, type-hint-driven library for building robust and user-friendly command-line interfaces.
- **Rich**: A fantastic library for beautiful terminal rendering, providing colors, tables, and rich text.
- **SQLite3**: Python's built-in module for interacting with SQLite, a lightweight, file-based relational database, used for persistent task storage.
- **python-dateutil**: A powerful library for parsing human-readable date and time strings.

## 4. Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the To-Do CLI application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GRACENOBLE/todo_cli.git
```

![image](/public/images/cloning.png)

**Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```bash
cd todo_cli
```

![image](/public/images/cd.png)

**Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
#or
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment:
# On macOS / Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

You should see `(.venv)` or similar at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

**Install Project in Editable Mode:**

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Database Initialization

This application uses a local SQLite database, stored in a single file named `tasks.db`. You will not find this file in the Git repository as it's generated locally for each user.

The first time you run any `tsk` command (e.g., `tsk add "My first task"`), the application will automatically:

- Create the `tasks.db` file in your project's root directory if it doesn't already exist.
- Set up the necessary `tasks` table structure inside that `tasks.db` file.

![database](/public/images/database.png)

This ensures a clean and automatic setup without any manual database configuration required from your end.

## 5. Usage

Once installed, you can start using the `tsk` command.

### tsk Command Overview

All interactions with the To-Do CLI app start with the `tsk` command, followed by a subcommand and its arguments/options.

### add command

Adds a new task to your to-do list.

```bash
tsk add "Your task description here" [--due <date>]
```

- `<description>`: (Required) The text of your task.
- `-due` or `d`: (Optional) Specify a due date.

**Accepted formats**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-12-31`), `today`, `tomorrow`, `next week`, `next month`, `next year`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add a simple task
tsk add "Finish project report"

# Add a task due on a specific date
tsk add "Schedule team meeting" --due 2025-06-01

# Add a task due tomorrow
tsk add "Call client about proposal" -d tomorrow

# Add a task due next week
tsk add "Plan weekend trip" -d "next week"
```

### list command

Lists tasks in your to-do list. By default, it shows only pending tasks.
![list yoour todos](/public/images/list.png)

```bash
tsk list [--all | --pending | --completed]
```

- `-all` or `a`: Show all tasks (including completed ones).
- `-pending` or `p`: Show only pending tasks (default behavior).
- `-completed` or `c`: Show only completed tasks.

Note: You can only use one of `--all`, `--pending`, or `--completed` at a time.

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all pending tasks (default)
tsk list

# List all tasks (pending and completed)
tsk list --all

# List only completed tasks
tsk list --completed
```

### complete command

Marks a task as complete.

```bash
tsk complete <task_id>
```

- `<task_id>`: (Required) The numerical ID of the task to mark as complete. You can find the task ID using the `list` command.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Mark task with ID 1 as complete
tsk complete 1

# If task 1 was already complete
tsk complete 1
# Output: Task 1 'Finish project report' is already completed.
```

![complete task](/public/images/complete.png)

### delete command

Deletes a task from the to-do list.

```bash
tsk delete <task_id> [--force]
```

- `<task_id>`: (Required) The numerical ID of the task to delete.
- `-force` or `f`: (Optional) Skip the confirmation prompt and delete immediately.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Delete task with ID 3 (will prompt for confirmation)
tsk delete 3

# Delete task with ID 2 without confirmation
tsk delete 2 --force
```

## Getting Help

You can always get help for the main application or specific commands using the `--help` flag:

```bash
# Get help for the main application
tsk --help

# Get help for the 'add' command
tsk add --help
```

## 6. Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for extending this application:

- **Edit Task**: Implement a command to modify task descriptions or due dates.
- **Search/Filter**: More advanced filtering options (e.g., by keyword, by date range).
- **Priorities**: Add a priority level to tasks.
- **Categories/Tags**: Organize tasks into categories or with tags.
- **Export/Import**: Allow exporting tasks to CSV/JSON or importing from them.
- **Undo/Redo**: Implement an undo/redo functionality.

## 7. License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](/LICENSE).

## 8. Additional considerations

Should you want to interact with your database of tasks, consider installing the db browser for sqlite
